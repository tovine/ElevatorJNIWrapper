__NOTE:__ In addition to the files in this directory, you need parts of the C elevator interface driver provided for the course (can be found at https://github.com/TTK4145/Project)

From the `simulator_2/client` directory, get the following files:
  - `con_load.h`
  - `elev.h`
  - `elev.c`
  
From the `driver` directory, get everything except for `Makefile`, `main.c`, and the `elev` files (we got the version with simulator support instead, remember?).
